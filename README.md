# page-rank
Page rank algorithm implementation using Python based on the concept introduced in "Search Engines: Information Retrieval in Practice" by W. Bruce Croft, Donald Meltzer, and Trevor Strohman. 

Pages are in the form:
```
source  destination
```

`source`: string (no whitespace)
`destination`: string (no whitespace)
source and destination is separated by `\t`
